# Wordpress clone - name TBD
CMS Platform that will provide a way for non-technical users to create simple websites with menus, images, text, etc. When creating individual pages, the interface will be block based, allowing users to select different size blocks and fill them with their content. They will also be able to drag and drop to rearrange them.

## Users/Accounts
1. Create accounts which allow them to launch instances of the CMS. The CMS will only have one role, admin (for now).

## Pages
1. User selects from a drop down of block types (just text, image or 'spacing' blocks for now). Once type is selected, its width can be adjusted. Blocks can be either full-width or sized in a 12 block grid. Blocks can be rearranged with drag and drop, but only if combined width of blocks on a row are <= 12.

### Block settings
1. Width
2. Background
3. CSS class
4. Padding/margin

### Page settings
1. Set background color
2. Set main container's width

## Menus/Navbars
1. Create menus, select its location (mobile, top, left, etc) and type (fixed, standard, etc) 
2. Add logo
3. Drag and drop menu items
4. Have pages that have been created appear as options to drag into the menu

## Footer
1. Edit the footer content

## Settings
1. Global page settings (set default width for all pages)
2. Edit default CSS
3. Edit global font
4. Edit different text header types? (e.g. h1, h2, etc setting font size and family)

## Bonus
1. Users: Heirarchical roles when users are created (e.g. content editor, subscriber, etc)
2. Pages: Additional block types (video, widgets, custom JS or HTML)
3. Email: Create email forms
